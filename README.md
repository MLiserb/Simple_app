# Simple_app

The goal is to create a simple application

Here is some example Python code to create a basic web API application that accepts the input parameters 
<br> and returns sample output as requested:
<br> code.py

This provides a basic Flask API with Swagger docs and sample output. 
<br> To extend it for v2, additional filtering logic could be added to the main endpoint function.
